Thanks a lot!

Project Overview:

Phase 1: Basic Communication Simulation

    Simulated direct commands from Pi controller to Maqueen (with no hardware).

    Demonstrated understanding of command flow (sending, receiving, responding).

Phase 2: SenseHAT Integration (Non-ROS)

    Added simulated joystick input using a mock sense_hat.py.

    Mapped joystick directions to movement commands and controlled Maqueen in code.

Phase 3: ROS2 Integration (Simulation)

    Refactored your logic to use a ROS2-inspired publisher/subscriber model (Input Node, Communication Node).

    Simulated ROS2 message types (Twist), message flow, and conversion logic.

    Explained the process and output in a way that mirrors a real ROS2 robotics system.
